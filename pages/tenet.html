            Tenet, directed by Christopher Nolan, is a mind-bending action thriller that involves time manipulation and
            inversion. The protagonist, a secret agent known only as "The Protagonist," must prevent a catastrophic event
            that could lead to World War III. With stunning action sequences and a complex narrative, Tenet keeps audiences
            on the edge of their seats.
