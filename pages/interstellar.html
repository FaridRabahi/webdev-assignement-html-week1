        Interstellar, directed by Christopher Nolan, is a thought-provoking science fiction film set in a future where
        Earth is facing ecological collapse. A group of astronauts embarks on a journey through a wormhole near Saturn
        to find a new habitable planet for humanity. The movie explores themes of space exploration, time dilation, and
        the power of love and sacrifice.
